## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- HTML Structure: Structure forms effectively, including the use of tags, input elements, and error messages for validation.

- CSS Styling: Gained experience in designing forms and making them responsive using CSS Grid and media queries.

- JavaScript Interaction: JavaScript was used to validate form inputs, handle form submission, and display messages.

### Continued development

- CSS Flexbox â€“ While you have used CSS Grid, consider learning more about CSS Flexbox as it can also be very useful for layout designs.

- Responsive Design: Maintain responsiveness by practicing design techniques, especially focusing on optimizing designs for various screen sizes and devices.

- Backend integration: The front-end form could be integrated with a backend service (such as Node.js with Express or a cloud service such as Firebase) for data storage and processing.

### Useful resources

- [HTML5 Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML) - Essential reference to understand and correctly use HTML tags.

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS) - Official documentation to take full advantage of CSS capabilities in designs.

- [Java Script](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/javascript) - Official documentation for understanding and using JavaScript effectively in web development, with detailed examples and guides.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Collaborative design tool that allows you to create prototypes and design user interfaces efficiently.

These resources will be very useful to continue learning and improving your skills in frontend development.
